## What Quvanti Is

Quvanti is a web and mobile application that lets anyone describe a trading strategy in plain English and receive an immediate, statistically rigorous evaluation of it. You type something like "Buy Bitcoin when the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA, sell when RSI exceeds 70, with a 2% stop loss" — and within 60 seconds the system parses that into executable logic, runs it against real historical price data, and returns a full quant analysis: Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, win rate, Monte Carlo confidence bands, walk-forward degradation score, volume profile key levels, and an overfit detection flag.

The target user is anyone who has trading ideas but no background in programming or quantitative finance — retail traders, finance students, analysts who want to stress-test an intuition before paper trading it.

---

## The Problem

Retail traders and finance students routinely backtest strategies on platforms like TradingView's Pine Script or Python/pandas notebooks. The barrier is high: you need to write code, source and clean data, avoid look-ahead bias, understand statistical significance, and know what questions to even ask of the results.

More subtly, most tools that do give you a backtest give you *optimistic* results. They use the same data to both fit and evaluate the strategy — a form of data dredging that produces win rates and Sharpe ratios that evaporate in live trading. Professional quant shops have known this for decades and use walk-forward analysis, out-of-sample testing, and Monte Carlo methods to catch it. These techniques are rarely exposed to retail users in an accessible form.

Quvanti's thesis is that the *methodology* is the product. Anyone can build a backtest button. Surfacing Hurst exponent, OOS degradation, Monte Carlo ruin probability, and overfit detection in a plain-language UI is the actual work.

---

## What It Does

1. **Natural language → strategy**: User writes a strategy in plain English. A Gemini 2.5 Flash call structured-extracts it into a parsed strategy object (entry rules, exit rules, risk management, position sizing). The extraction includes an auto-retry on JSON parse failure and a deterministic fallback if the AI cannot parse the input.

2. **Real backtesting**: Point-in-time OHLCV data is fetched from CoinGecko (crypto) or yFinance (equities). The backtest engine simulates trade-by-trade execution with configurable slippage and commission. Output includes equity curve, per-trade log, Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, and max drawdown.

3. **Quant validation layer**: After backtesting, the strategy is run through:
   - Monte Carlo simulation (1,000 GBM paths from observed μ/σ)
   - Walk-forward analysis (in-sample vs. out-of-sample Sharpe comparison)
   - Overfit detection (win rate vs. trade count heuristic + degradation ratio)
   - Volume profile (POC, VAH, VAL from VWAP clustering)
   - Hurst exponent (long-memory / mean-reversion classification)

4. **Paper trading**: Users can execute virtual trades via a paper account tracked in the database (not localStorage for the persistent version). Real-time prices are fetched on execution.

5. **AI agent system**: Users can create named "agents" — persistent strategy configurations stored in the database that can be paused, resumed, and monitored. Agents emit execution logs via a Server-Sent Events stream.

6. **Signal feed**: A signals table is populated by a generate endpoint (AI + quant engine). Signals are shown in the web and mobile UI with confidence scores and expected return estimates. Free-tier users see locked signals; Pro users see all.

7. **Strategy Lab**: A separate multi-turn conversational interface for iterating on a strategy description before committing it to an agent.

8. **Broker connectivity**: An Alpaca integration layer (API key storage, order routing, live portfolio sync) exists in the codebase. Paper trading and live routing are toggled via an execution mode switch.

### Data flow: strategy creation

```
User inputs natural language strategy
  → POST /api/agents/create
  → Auth check (session)
  → Subscription + usage gate
  → Gemini 2.5 Flash (JSON extraction)
  → extractJSON() + validateStrategy() normalisation
  → fetchHistoricalData() (CoinGecko or yFinance)
  → runBacktest() — point-in-time trade simulation
  → runMonteCarloSimulation() — 1,000 GBM paths
  → runWalkForwardAnalysis() — OOS vs IS Sharpe
  → detectOverfitting() — heuristic flag
  → calculateVolumeProfile() — POC/VAH/VAL
  → calculateHurstExponent() — regime classification
  → INSERT agents + backtests to DB
  → Return full results to client
```

## Technical Methodology

Each technique below is implemented in the codebase (location noted) and runs on every strategy creation.

### Hurst Exponent
**What it does:** Measures long-range dependence in a price time series. H > 0.5 indicates trending (persistent) behaviour; H < 0.5 indicates mean-reverting; H ≈ 0.5 indicates a random walk.

**Why Quvanti uses it:** A momentum strategy applied to a mean-reverting asset (H < 0.5) will statistically underperform. The Hurst exponent lets users see whether the underlying market regime suits their strategy type before live trading.

**Where:** `apps/web/src/app/api/utils/marketData.js` → `calculateHurstExponent()` using R/S analysis over log-return windows. Also exposed as a client-side utility in `apps/web/src/app/api/utils/quant.js` → `computeHurstExponent()`.

---

### Monte Carlo Simulation
**What it does:** Simulates 1,000 independent price paths using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) with μ (drift) and σ (volatility) derived from the historical return distribution. For each path, the strategy rules are replayed to produce a final capital value. The output is a distribution of outcomes from which probability of ruin, 95% confidence bands, and expected value are extracted.

**Why Quvanti uses it:** A backtest result on a single historical path may be lucky or unlucky. Monte Carlo reveals the full range of plausible outcomes under the same strategy parameters — a standard hedge-fund risk assessment step.

**Where:** `apps/web/src/app/api/utils/monteCarloEngine.js` → `runMonteCarloSimulation()`.

---

### Walk-Forward Analysis
**What it does:** Splits historical data into rolling in-sample (IS) and out-of-sample (OOS) windows. The strategy is fitted on IS data and evaluated on OOS data. Sharpe ratio degradation = (IS Sharpe − OOS Sharpe) / IS Sharpe.

**Why Quvanti uses it:** A strategy optimised purely on historical data will curve-fit. Walk-forward analysis quantifies how much performance degrades on unseen data. Degradation > 30–40% is a strong overfit signal.

**Where:** `apps/web/src/app/api/utils/monteCarloEngine.js` → `runWalkForwardAnalysis()`.

---

### Overfit Detection
**What it does:** Applies a heuristic scoring function to detect likely curve-fitting: primarily checks whether win rate is implausibly high given trade count, and whether IS/OOS degradation crosses a threshold. Returns an overfit score (0–10) and a boolean flag.

**Why Quvanti uses it:** Retail backtesting tools routinely produce strategies with 90%+ win rates on 4 trades. Surfacing this automatically prevents users from placing real money on statistically invalid results.

**Where:** `apps/web/src/app/api/utils/monteCarloEngine.js` → `detectOverfitting()`.

---

### Volume Profile (POC / VAH / VAL)
**What it does:** Clusters historical volume by price level to identify the Point of Control (POC — highest volume price), Value Area High (VAH — upper boundary of 70% volume concentration), and Value Area Low (VAL — lower boundary).

**Why Quvanti uses it:** These levels act as statistically significant support and resistance because large proportions of historical trading occurred there. Entry/exit rules near POC have an evidential basis; arbitrary levels do not.

**Where:** `apps/web/src/app/api/utils/volumeProfile.js` → `calculateVolumeProfile()`.

---

### Order Flow Imbalance (OFI)
**What it does:** Computes the asymmetry between bid-side and ask-side order book pressure over rolling windows. Sustained OFI > 95th-percentile threshold indicates abnormally large directional interest — often indicative of institutional or algorithmic flow.

**Why Quvanti uses it:** Price moves driven by order flow imbalance are more directionally reliable than price moves in balanced books. The OFI monitor ("Whale Tracker") alerts users to potential conviction signals before price reacts.

**Where:** `apps/web/src/app/api/utils/orderFlow.js` → OFI calculation; `apps/web/src/app/api/quant-engine/ofi/route.js` → HTTP endpoint; `apps/web/src/components/WhaleTracker.jsx` → UI.

---

### Slippage Modelling
**What it does:** Estimates realistic execution cost on each simulated trade using spread (basis points) and market-impact estimation based on `sqrt(qty)` scaling. Limit orders are assigned zero slippage; market orders carry both spread and impact costs.

**Why Quvanti uses it:** Naive backtests assume fills at the exact signal price. Real execution costs can turn a profitable strategy unprofitable at scale. Including a slippage model prevents this class of unrealistic result.

**Where:** `apps/web/src/app/api/utils/realBacktest.js` and `apps/web/src/store/useOmniStore.js` → `computeSlippage()`.

---

### LLM Response Cache
**What it does:** Hashes the user's strategy prompt with SHA-256. On a cache hit in the `llm_cache` table, the stored structured strategy is returned immediately without an AI call.

**Why Quvanti uses it:** Identical prompts produce identical strategies. Caching avoids redundant LLM spend and reduces latency for common queries.

**Where:** `apps/web/src/app/api/strategy-lab/parse/route.js` and `apps/web/src/app/api/agents/create/route.js`.

---

### Audit Log with Tamper-Evident Chain
**What it does:** Every security-relevant event is written to `audit_logs` with a `lineage_hash` field computed from the SHA-256 of the previous entry's hash concatenated with the current event's content. This creates a chain where any tampering of a past entry invalidates all subsequent hashes.

**Why Quvanti uses it:** Financial application audit trails require tamper evidence. The chain design is inspired by append-only log techniques used in accounting and blockchain systems — though at a much simpler level appropriate for a web application.

**Where:** `apps/web/src/app/api/audit/log/route.js`; `lineage_hash` and `prev_hash` columns in `audit_logs` table.

## Development

### Web

```bash
cd apps/web
npm run dev       # Development server with hot reload
npm run build     # Production build
npm run lint      # ESLint
```

### Mobile

```bash
cd apps/mobile
npx expo start        # Expo development server
npx expo start --ios  # iOS simulator
npx expo start --android # Android emulator
```

---

## Mobile App

The Expo companion app (`apps/mobile`) mirrors core functionality of the web app:

- **Dashboard tab** — agent list with P&L, win rate, subscription status
- **Signals tab** — live signal feed with buy/sell filter
- **Alerts tab** — notification-style alert list
- **Profile tab** — user info, sign out, navigation to legal pages
- **Create Agent screen** — natural language agent creation with toast feedback

Authentication in the mobile app opens a WebView to the web app's sign-in/sign-up pages, then bridges the session token back to the native app.

---

## Database Schema

The full schema is in the database. Key tables and their purpose:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|

## AI Assistance

This project was built with significant AI tool assistance (primarily Claude and Gemini) for scaffolding, component generation, utility functions, and iteration speed. The following were entirely human-directed:

- Product concept and core thesis (methodology as the product)
- Architecture decisions (Next.js App Router, Neon serverless, Zustand slices, SSE streaming)
- Quantitative methodology choices (which quant techniques to implement and why)
- Security design (tamper-evident audit chain, input sanitisation layer, CSRF middleware)
- Business logic (tier gating, usage limits, idempotency key on agent creation)
- UI/UX decisions (neural canvas hero, HUD overlays, terminal-style components)
- Debugging and fixing edge cases in backtest logic, Monte Carlo paths, JSON extraction
- Database schema design
- API contract design
- Integration decisions (Paddle for payments, Alpaca for brokerage, CoinGecko for data)
- Testing and verification of quant outputs

AI tools were used to accelerate implementation velocity, not to make product or methodology decisions. All generated code was reviewed, debugged, and modified before being used in production.

## Limitations

- **No real-money trading**: The broker integration layer exists but live order routing to real markets has not been fully validated for production use. Use paper trading mode.
- **Data source**: Crypto backtesting uses CoinGecko (free tier has rate limits). Equity data uses yFinance which is unofficial and may break.
- **Slippage model is approximate**: The sqrt(qty) market impact formula is a simplification. Actual market impact varies significantly by venue and asset.
- **LLM parsing failures**: If Gemini 2.5 Flash produces malformed JSON, the system falls back to a default RSI template. The user is notified but the parsed strategy may not match their intent exactly.
- **Walk-forward window size**: Fixed windows are used. Adaptive walk-forward windows would improve out-of-sample validity.
- **Mobile alerts**: The mobile alerts tab uses static mock data and is not yet wired to the backend alerts table.
- **No email notifications**: Alerts are in-app only; no email or push notification delivery is implemented.

---

## Roadmap

- Wire mobile alerts tab to `/api/alerts/list`
- Adaptive walk-forward window sizing
- Pine Script / Python full export (currently skeleton only)
- Email notification delivery for alerts
- Real equity data source (replace unofficial yFinance)
- Portfolio-level Monte Carlo (multi-agent correlation)
- Expanded broker integrations (IBKR live, Coinbase)
- Backtesting for forex and commodities
- Strategy sharing marketplace (public share token system exists, UI partially built)
